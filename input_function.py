a = input("Enter the first no: ") # 32
b = input("Enter the second no: ") # 45
print(a + b) # output will be 3245 because in pyhton when something (it can be int, float, string, boolean) is given as input, it will be taken as string

c = int(input("Enter the first number: ")) # 32
d = int(input("Enter the second number: ")) # 45
print(c + d) # output will 77
